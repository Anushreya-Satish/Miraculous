              Juleka Couffaine is a student in Miss Bustier's class at
              Collège Françoise Dupont. She is also the younger twin sister of
              Luka Couffaine. In "Reflekta", after being locked in the
              bathroom by Sabrina Raincomprix (under the orders from Chloé
              Bourgeois) to prevent Juleka from participating in the class
              photo, she is akumatized by Hawk Moth and becomes Reflekta, a
              supervillain who turns people into copies of herself. In
              "Reflekdoll", after Juleka misses the chance to the photoshoot for
              Marinette's design, she is once again akumatized by Hawk Moth into
              Reflekta. She is also amokized by Mayura, which caused her
              frustration and misery to form Reflekdoll, a doll-themed
              sentimonster which enhances her powers. In "Félix", after being
              fooled by Félix to think that Adrien didn't appreciate his
              friends, Juleka is re-akumatized into Reflekta, and, along with
              Princess Fragrance and Lady Wifi, the three supervillains all form
              the The Punishers Trio, a group of supervillains who want to get
              revenge on Adrien, later Félix. In "Gang of Secrets", after
              Marinette keeps hiding secrets from them, Juleka is re-akumatized
              by Shadow Moth into Reflekta along with Lady Wifi, Princess
              Fragrance, Timebreaker and Horrificator, the five supervillains
              all form the Gang of Secrets, a group of supervillains who want to
              reveal Marinette's secrets. In "Guiltrip", Juleka tells the class
              a secret involving Rose where she has a medical condition and
              occasionally requires hospital care. After Rose snaps at the class
              for being too overprotective, Juleka feels guilty, getting
              re-akumatized and amokized into Reflekta by Shadow Moth, and her
              guilt and sadness form Guiltrip, a portal-like sentimonster that
              makes people feel guilty. She is also a member of Kitty Section.
