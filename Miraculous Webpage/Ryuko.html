              Kagami Tsurugi just arrived in Paris. An excellent fencer, she has
              a great sense of honor and a strong will to succeed in everything
              she does. She probably takes after her mother, Tomoe, who is as
              demanding of her as Gabriel Agreste is of his son. Kagami has
              powerful feelings for Adrien, but also for Marinette, who has
              become her friend. Kagami is the holder of the Miraculous of the
              dragon, which grants the power of perfection. With the help of her
              kwami Longg, she transforms into Ry√ªko. She was akumatized twice in 
              Riposte & Oni-Chan.
