              Nino Lahiffe is Adrien’s best friend, dude! He’s a cool kid who
              always speaks his mind, which makes him the perfect boyfriend for
              Alya, who hates lying. Nino is the holder of the Miraculous of the
              turtle, which grants the power of protection. With the help of his
              kwami Wayzz, he transforms into Carapace. He has told Adrien that
              he is Carapace and also Alya is Rena Rouge. His akumatized forms
              are Oblivio , Bubbler & Rocketear.
