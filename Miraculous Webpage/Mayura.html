              Nathalie Sancoeur is Gabriel Agreste's assistant. Officially. In
              reality, she is secretly his accomplice in his quest for
              Miraculous. Beneath a cold and insensitive exterior, Nathalie
              cares about Adrien. She is the one who convinced Gabriel to give
              Adrien a little freedom by letting him go to school. Nathalie
              gradually establishes herself as a substitute mother to Adrien.
              Nathalie is the holder of the Miraculous of the peacock, which
              grants the power of emotion. With the help of her kwami Duusu, she
              transforms into Mayura.
