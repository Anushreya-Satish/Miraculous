              Luka Couphène is Juleka’s twin brother. Even though he is
              passionate about music, he doesn’t want to become a rock star. He
              wants to make stringed instruments for people to create emotions
              with. Always available, Luka helps his friends get in touch with
              their inner tunes. Luka is the holder of the Miraculous of the
              snake, which grants the power of intuition. With the help of his
              kwami Sass, he transforms into Viperion. He was akumatized twice 
              - Silencer & Truth. Now he knows both Ladybug & Cat Noir's identity.
              He is also a member of Kitty Section.
