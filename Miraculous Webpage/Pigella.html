              Rose Lavillant is a student in Miss Bustier's class at Collège
              Françoise Dupont. In "Princess Fragrance" after Chloé Bourgeois
              teased Rose and tears up her letter to Prince Ali, she is
              akumatized by Hawk Moth and becomes Princess Fragrance, a
              perfume-shooting supervillain. In "Félix" after being fooled by
              Félix into thinking that Adrien does not appreciate his friends,
              Rose is re-akumatized into Princess Fragrance along with Reflekta
              (Juleka) and Lady Wifi (Alya), the three supervillains form the
              The Punishers Trio, a group of supervillains who want to get
              revenge on Adrien (Félix disguised as Adrien). In "Gang of
              Secrets" after Marinette keeps hiding secrets from her friends,
              Rose is re-akumatized by Shadow Moth into Princess Fragrance along
              with Lady Wifi, Reflekta, Timebreaker and Horrificator. These five
              supervillains form the Gang of Secrets, a group of supervillains
              who want to reveal Marinette's secrets. In "Guiltrip", after
              Juleka is re-akumatized into Reflekta and the students are
              captured by her titular sentimonster, Rose receives the Pig
              Miraculous from Ladybug. When the Miraculous is inhabited by
              Daizzi, Rose becomes Pigella, a pig-themed superhero who helps
              Ladybug and Cat Noir ‘during particularly different missions’ in
              the fourth season and beyond. It is also revealed she got
              sick when she was younger, and the sickness can reappear at any
              second. The exact illness is not revealed. She is also a member of Kitty Section.
