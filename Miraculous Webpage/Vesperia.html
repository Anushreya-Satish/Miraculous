              Zoé Lee is a teenage girl from New York City and a student in
              Ms. Mendeleiev's class at Collège Françoise Dupont. She is also
              Chloé Bourgeois' half-sister. She attended a boarding school
              back in New York, where she used to live with her mother. In "Sole
              Crusher", after being tired of hiding her true self in order to
              please her half-sister, Zoé is akumatized by Shadow Moth into Sole
              Crusher, a supervillain who can absorb people and becomes larger
              by stomping on or kicking them. In "Queen Banana", after
              Chloé is akumatized into the titular villain, Zoé receives the Bee
              Miraculous from Ladybug. When the Miraculous is inhabited by
              Pollen, Zoé becomes Vesperia, a bee/wasp-themed superhero who
              helps Ladybug and Cat Noir during particularly difficult missions
              in the fourth season and beyond.
