              Jessica Keynes, most commonly known as "Jess", is a student at
              Armstrong High School. She is also a superhero in the United
              States of America and Knightowl's partner and daughter. She was
              initially known as Sparrow, being the latest in a line of teacher
              and student who have worn the masks of the legendary hero duo,
              Knightowl and Sparrow. After the Eagle Miraculous was recovered
              from Miraclonizer, she used it to free the American superheroes
              from the Miraculous' power. Ladybug allowed her to keep the Eagle
              Miraculous, believing it would be in good hands. When the talon
              pendant is inhabited by Liiri, Jess transforms into the
              super-heroine Eagle, gaining the power of freedom.
