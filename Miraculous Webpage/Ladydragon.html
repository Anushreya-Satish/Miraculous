              Fei Wu  is a teenage girl
              living in Shanghai, China. She was found by Wu Shifu as a baby on
              the doorstep of his Martial Arts School and raised by him as his
              adopted daughter. Wu Shifu trained her in the martial arts and
              raised her to uphold the values and one day take over as guardian
              of the Sacred Cave. After Wu Shifu died and his school was
              destroyed, Fei became a thief to amass enough money to pay off a
              local crime boss who claimed he could tell her the truth about her
              adoptive father's fate.
