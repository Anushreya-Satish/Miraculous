              Kwamis are divine beings that are formed whenever a new abstract
              idea or emotion comes into existence in the universe, such as
              creation, love, beauty, and mathematics. The very first Kwami ever
              to come into existence is Tikki, the Kwami of Creation, who came
              into existence upon the creation of the universe. All of the
              Kwamis know each other and journeyed across the universe for eons.
              During their travels, they found their way to Earth and at some
              point and discovered their magical powers, born from the abstract
              concepts that they respectively embody, with Plagg using his
              powers to cause the extinction of the dinosaurs. That's when the
              kwamis realized, even though their powers were great, they were
              too strong and unfocused, leading to great damage. During their
              ancient past, the kwamis witnessed the rise of humanity and with
              it, from 5 to 7 million years ago, the birth of their "cousins"
              the Renlings. However, the Kwamis were spirit-like, and thus
              couldn't be perceived by regular, tangible lifeforms, such as
              humans, and were therefore unable to interact with them. Despite
              that they had a deep yearning to learn more about humans
              unknowingly observing them.
