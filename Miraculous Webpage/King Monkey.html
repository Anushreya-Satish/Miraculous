              Kim Ature is Maxâ€™s human best friend. He is a great athlete who
              excels at swimming. With him, everything is a chance for a
              challenge, a competition and a good laugh! Kim is the holder of
              the Miraculous of the monkey, which grants the power of derision.
              With the help of his kwami Xuppu, he transforms into King Monkey.
